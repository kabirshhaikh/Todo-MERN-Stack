# Todo-MERN-Stack

In the following project, I have made a Backend in Nodejs using ExpressJs library and a frontend using Reactjs.
I am using a MVC architecture for the backend, where I have created User access and User performed task actions.
A task created by a user can only be modified/updated or deleted by that particular user.
For authorization, I am using Basic Auth.
